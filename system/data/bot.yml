# Toggles whether your bot will group greet/bye messages into a single message every 5 seconds.
# 1st user who joins will get greeted immediately
# If more users join within the next 5 seconds, they will be greeted in groups of 5.
# This will cause %user.mention% and other placeholders to be replaced with multiple users.
# Keep in mind this might break some of your embeds - for example if you have %user.avatar% in the thumbnail,
# it will become invalid, as it will resolve to a list of avatars of grouped users.
# note: This setting is primarily used if you're afraid of raids, or you're running medium/large bots where some
# servers might get hundreds of people join at once. This is used to prevent the bot from getting ratelimited,
# and (slightly) reduce the greet spam in those servers.
groupGreets: false
# Whether the bot will rotate through all specified statuses.
# This setting can be changed via .ropl command.
# See RotatingStatuses submodule in Administration.
